# Rails Ghetto

Description
===========

Chef cookbook intended for managing & deployment of multiple rack-based applications living on one server behind nginx. Supports asset pipeline right from the box.

Uses nginx + unicorn to run applications.

Requirements
============

Cookbook depends on several opscode's cookbooks:

* [application](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application)
* [application_ruby](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/application_ruby)
* [nginx](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/nginx)

Recipes
=======

* `rails_ghetto::user` - creates user and group (if they aren't exist) that are used to deploy & run applications
* `rails_ghetto::nginx_sites_enable` - creates and enables nginx configuration files 
* `rails_ghetto::deploy` - deploys application. *Caution* - [revision based deploy](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Deploy+Resource#DeployResource-DeployResource) is used to ensure that chef-client runs will not re-deploy all applications. Make sure you understand how it works.

Attributes
==========

Here is a sample YAML representation of attributes hierarchy:

    rails_ghetto:
      deployment_user: deploy
      deployment_group: deploy
      apps_root: /var/www/apps
      applications:
